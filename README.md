# ios-vloom

## Getting Started

You need CocoaPods (https://cocoapods.org/) to handle dependencies, so if it's not installed yet you should run the following command:

`$ sudo gem install cocoapods`

Then move to the project's directory and run:

`$ pod install`

This will download all the dependencies for the Xcode project and will create a new file named `Vloom.xcworkspace`. You should use that file to open the Xcode project and run the app.
